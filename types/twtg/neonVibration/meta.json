  "description": "The NEON Vibration Sensor sends alerts, as soon as assets, such as engines, conveyor belts, and pumps start to fail. This sets off a trigger when a change of amplitude is detected in the vibration spectrum or when deviations in the data occur. With this, in combination with an on site maintenance team, failure or long-term damage can be prevented. That way, assets that are not under constant supervision from operators, can be monitored around the clock.",
