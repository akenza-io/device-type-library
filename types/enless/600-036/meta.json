  "description": "The Enless LoRa pulse sensor allows you to count the pulses of the connected meter. This remote reading sensor can be used with any type of meter that has a dry-contact or open collector output. The LoRa pulse sensor counts the number of pulses generated by the meter and periodically sends the meter index value. Particularly useful for monitoring consumption and detecting potential leaks or overconsumption, the LoRa pulse sensor can transform a traditional pulse meter into a communicating meter. The PULSE LoRa Enless sensor has two pulse inputs that can be used simultaneously to manage the counting of two meters simultaneously.",
