  "description": "The LoRa Enless LED flash reading sensor allows you to count the light flashes (not infrared) from electric meters. The installation of the optical reading head is simplified and non-intrusive thanks to an adhesive viewfinder that is installed at the level of the meterâ€™s diode. The Pulse LED LoRa sensor counts the number of flashes generated by the meters and converts them into pulses before sending the data via radio.",
